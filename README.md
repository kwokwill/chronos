<h1>Welcome to Chronos!</h1>


Chronos is a web-based application that allows BCIT CST students to view all upcoming assignments, 
quizzes, and exams in an easy to read format. A calendar is also available for setting personal event 
reminders. With the progression of the project, Chronos flourished to become a fully functional, and responsive 
app - working both on mobile and on desktops.

Chronos strives to provide CST students with the best calendar and course view all in the tip of their fingers.
Chronos was built with Firebase, Firestore, HTML, CSS, and JS.
